## Introduction

[x] 1.1: Why Tests.
        
        * Summary: Software does what it is supposed to do:
                - Kostnadseffektiv: If bugs/defects found early in dev-cycle. Costs less if found early on.
                - SÃ¤kerhet: Customer looking for trustworthy products/without problems.
                - Quality: Testing ensures good quality
                - Customer Satisfaction: User experience etc. speaks for itself I guess.

| Manual Testing 	|   	|
|----------------	|---	|
| Exploratory Testing              	| n 	|
| n              	| n 	|
| n              	| n 	|

| Automated Testing 	|   	|
|-------------------	|---	|
| Unit Test        	       | (*Good for health care*), tests an individual function, that the function matches the expected outcome. Cheap and easy to implement with high ROI. 	|
| End-To-End/System Test          	| Simulates and tests a user story. An example that a user "can login" etc, to ensure a bug free experience.	|
| Integration Test     	| Testing for example the connectivity and data transfer between implemented modules. 	|
