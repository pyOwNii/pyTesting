## Introduction

[x] 1.1: Why Tests.
        
        * Summary: Software does what it is supposed to do:
                - Kostnadseffektiv: If bugs/defects found early in dev-cycle. Costs less if found early on.
                - SÃ¤kerhet: Customer looking for trustworthy products/without problems.
                - Quality: Testing ensures good quality
                - Customer Satisfaction: User experience etc. speaks for itself I guess.
