## 1. Introduction

[x] 1.1: Why Tests.
        
        * Summary: Software does what it is supposed to do:
                - Kostnadseffektiv: If bugs/defects found early in dev-cycle. Costs less if found early on.
                - SÃ¤kerhet: Customer looking for trustworthy products/without problems.
                - Quality: Testing ensures good quality
                - Customer Satisfaction: User experience etc. speaks for itself I guess.

[x]	1.2: Types of tests.

| Manual Testing 	|   	|
|----------------	|---	|
| Exploratory Testing              	| Random tests that are unscripted to find bugs or unintended behaviour	|
| Usability/Visual regression Testing              	| UI elements, mispositions, wrong fonts etc. 	|


| Automated Testing 	|   	|
|-------------------	|---	|
| Unit Test        	       | (*Good for health care*), tests an individual function, that the function matches the expected outcome. Cheap and easy to implement with high ROI. 	|
| End-To-End/System Test          	| Simulates and tests a user story. An example that a user "can login" etc, to ensure a bug free experience.	|
| Integration Test     	| Testing for example the connectivity and data transfer between implemented modules. 	|

[x]	1.3: Python Vs. Java on testing.

        - Depending on framework, for example on selenium/webdriver both can be used independent on the code the software was programmed in.
        - .py is easier than java. (shorter syntax(es), understandable code, "more" web support)
        - .py has broader range of "usability" like testing security, 
        - Java pros; better IDE, more people has knowledge of Java, could lead to an inhouse support if neccessary, depending on language used by the devs.


## 2. Testing in Python:

[]	2.2: unittest

                - Most common module for testing with python.
                - Also possible to use with frameworks such as selenium

[]	2.3: 

## 3. Testing Frameworks 

[]      3.1: Scripting in Selenium webdriver
